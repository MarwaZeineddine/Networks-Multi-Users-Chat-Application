# Networks-Multi-Users-Chat-Application
In the networks project, completed with a partner, we developed a multi-user chat application(up to N users) in Python. Using asyncio, Scapy, and socket programming, we created a robust platform for users to exchange messages. Our work included server and client implementations, packet manipulation with Scapy, and exploring channel encoding techniques. The project aimed to provide a reliable chat application while exploring decision-making techniques' applicability.
